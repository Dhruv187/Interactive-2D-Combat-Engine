## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

The engine is built with a production-level component-based architecture focusing on:

```
📂 CORE ENGINE
  ├── Camera System - Smooth tracking of combat action
  ├── Context Handler - Efficient canvas rendering
  ├── Entity Management - Object interaction and lifecycle
  ├── Input System - Responsive controls with combo detection
  └── Sound Handler - Dynamic audio management

📂 GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS
  ├── State Machines - Character and game state management
  ├── Collision Detection - Precise hit detection with prioritization
  ├── Animation System - Frame-based sprite animations
  └── Scene Management - Seamless transitions between game screens
```

## 💡 CORE BATTLE LOGIC

The battle system is powered by four key components that work together to create a responsive and dynamic fighting experience:

### 🎬 BattleScene

The central hub for all battle interactions:

- **Fighter Management**: Controls initialization, updates, and rendering of fighters
- **Dynamic Camera**: Intelligently tracks both fighters to keep them in view
- **Animation & Effects**: Manages hit effects, splashes, and screen shake for impact
- **Game State Control**: Tracks health, victory conditions, and scene transitions

### 👊 Fighter System

The backbone of character behavior and actions:

- **State-Driven Animation**: Manages transitions between idle, walking, jumping, and attack states
- **Physics Engine**: Controls velocity, position, and collision responses
- **Attack Logic**: Precision hit detection with different attack strengths and effects
- **Sound Integration**: Triggers context-appropriate sound effects for all actions

### 🎮 ControlHistory

Special move detection system:

- **Input Tracking**: Records player control sequences with timing precision
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies button combinations that trigger special moves
- **Move Execution**: Translates complex inputs into character-specific special attacks

### 📹 Camera System

Smart viewport management:

- **Dynamic Tracking**: Follows fighter movements while maintaining optimal viewing distance
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Prevents camera from exceeding stage limits
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides fluid camera movement during intense battles

## 🚀 PHASE 2 - COMING SOON
